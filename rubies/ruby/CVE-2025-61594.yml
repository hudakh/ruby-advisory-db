title: URI Credential Leakage Bypass
date: 2025-10-07
description: |
  A vulnerability in the URI library bundled with Ruby allows sensitive user credentials
  (such as usernames or passwords) in a URI to be unintentionally leaked when combining
  URIs using the `+` operator. This issue bypasses the previous fix for CVE-2025-27221.

  The issue affects Ruby's built-in URI implementation prior to Ruby 3.3.10 and 3.4.7.
affected_versions:
  - ">= 3.3.0, < 3.3.10"
  - ">= 3.4.0, < 3.4.7"
patched_versions:
  - ">= 3.3.10"
  - ">= 3.4.7"
